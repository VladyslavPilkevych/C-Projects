<h1>Character Counter and Author Identifier</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This project is a C program that manages a collection of post IDs and author names, providing functionalities to count character occurrences and filter authors based on specific markers.
</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Character Counting:</strong> Users can input two numbers, <code>k</code> and <code>l</code>, to specify a range for character counting in the post IDs. The program will display the frequency of each character within the specified limits.</li>
<li><strong>Author Filtering:</strong> The program identifies authors based on specific markers (<code>#A#</code>, <code>#K#</code>) within their names, allowing for easy categorization and display of relevant authors.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Memory Management:</strong> The program uses dynamic memory allocation to manage the IDs and author names efficiently, ensuring optimal use of resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
<li>Compile the program using a C compiler.</li>
<li>Run the executable and input commands:
<ul>
<li>Press <code>v</code> to display all IDs and author names.</li>
<li>Press <code>x</code> to count character occurrences in post IDs.</li>
<li>Press <code>e</code> to filter authors by specific markers.</li>
<li>Press <code>k</code> to exit the program.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example Inputs</h2>
<p>
For character counting, enter <code>1 5</code> to count characters from position 1 to 5.<br>
For filtering authors, input specific markers to see the filtered results.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
This project serves as an example of basic data management and text processing in C, showcasing skills in programming, memory management, and user interaction.
